// In the browser, JavaScript module execution depends upon import and export statements. These statements load and export ES modules, respectively. This is the standard and official way to reuse modules in JavaScript, and itâ€™s what most web browsers natively support.

// Node.js, by default, supports the CommonJS module format, which loads modules using the require() function, and exports them with module.exports.
